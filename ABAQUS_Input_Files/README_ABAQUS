In this directory we provide the ABAQUS input files that have been used in the benchmarking exercises detailed in the main paper.

ABAQUS is a commercial software that must be purchased in order to run these files, full details can be found at: https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/. We use version 2018 in this study.

The input files have been created using a combination of the graphical user interface and python scripting. All the main elements of the model, as described by the keywords, are detailed in the main text of the paper.

The input files can be run by opening the graphical interface, importing the model and creating a job to run, or using the command line by executing the command "abaqus job=EARTHQUAKE input=dip_30_reverse"
