Directory contents:

VISCO1D_Input_Files:
Input files for each of the benchmarking exercises for one time step which can be used in conjunction with the earth model files. A README contains information on how to obtain and run the VISCO1D software.
VISCO1D_Earth_Models: The input earth models used for the benchmarking exercises for both Maxwell and Burgers rheology.

ABAQUS_Input_Files:
Input files for the ABAQUS postseismic models for each of the benchmarking exercises:
1) Strike-slip fault
2) 30 degree dipping fault
3) 45 degree dipping fault (Maxwell rheology)
4) 45 degree dipping fault (Burgers rheology)
A README explaining how to run the input files in ABAQUS.
